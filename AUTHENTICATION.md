## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Context
The app uses React Context for state management:
- `AuthProvider`: Wraps the entire app and provides authentication state
- `useAuth`: Hook to access authentication functions and user state

### Protected Routes
- `ProtectedRoute`: Component that redirects unauthenticated users to login
- Applied to `/dashboard` and `/profile` routes

### Local Storage
- User sessions are persisted in localStorage
- Automatic session restoration on app load
- Secure session cleanup on logout

### Form Validation
- Real-time validation for all input fields
- Password strength indicators
- Email format validation
- Required field validation
